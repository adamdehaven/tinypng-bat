# TinyPNG for Windows

1. Get an API key from [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/developers)
2. Open the `tinypng.bat` file with your text editor and enter your TinyPNG API key
    ```
    set APIKEY=XXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXX
    ```
3. Add a prefix to the new file, if desired (otherwise, the script will overwrite the existing file).
4. Add all files you'd like to compress to the folder containing the repo files.
5. Run the `tinypng.bat` file to start the process.
